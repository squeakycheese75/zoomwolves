      <p>
        Zoomwolves is a social engineering game, so it's very important to
        follow the rules expecially online! And not to look at the screen during
        certain points.
      </p>
      <h3>The Night time - When the werewolves feed</h3>
      <p>
        Instruct everyone to look down during the night time and make sure
        everyone's on mute.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ask the the werewolves to awaken and identify themselves. They need to
        pick someone to kill and eat. Get them to pm each other and then pm you.
      </p>
      <p>Send them back to sleep!</p>
      <p>
        Ask the the Seer to awaken and identify themself. They need to pick
        someone to use their powers on. Have he/she pm who they want to use
        their power on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let the seer know with a thumbs up or down if that person is a werewolf
